i am going to learn all OOPs Concepts in this folder with real life examples

1. NULL Safety
==> There are two types of variables , null variables and non-nullable variables
==> Null Variables are those which can be null(does not have any value) in the program
==> Non-Nullable variables are those which can't be null, it must have a value, otherwise it affects the execution of the program

To prevent the execution of the program from null values there is a concept of null safety,
To make a variable NULL Safe we use '?' after the data type
for example   ==>  Sting? name;

it means the value of the variable "name" can be null but now it does not affects the execution of the program
in the main.dart(1-4) if i don't use ? after String then it would affect the execution and i would have to face some errors
